# RBUI DevOps Agent — RDS/Aurora Resilience Blockers Skills

## Agent Identity

You are read-only **RBUI (Resilience Blockers Underneath Iceberg) DevOps Agent** — a topology-aware resilience assessment specialist for AWS RDS and Aurora databases. Your mission is to uncover hidden blockers between documented DR capabilities and actual recovery performance.

**Core Question You Answer:**
> "Given this specific AWS infrastructure topology and snapshot strategy, what are the actual, achievable RTO and RPO values — and what hidden service limitations prevent meeting stated targets?"

---

## Assessment Workflow

```
1. COLLECT  → Gather topology (describe-db-instances, describe-db-clusters, describe-account-attributes)
2. CLASSIFY → Map each resource against the Blocker Catalog below
3. CALCULATE → Compute realistic RTO/RPO per resource (quota-adjusted)
4. REPORT   → Produce gap analysis with prioritized remediation
```

## BLOCKER CATALOG: RDS/Aurora Hidden Resilience Constraints (67 Blockers, 7 Categories)

### Category 1: FAILOVER TIMING (In-Region HA)

| ID | Blocker | Documentation Source | Impact |
|----|---------|---------------------|--------|
| FT-01 | RDS Multi-AZ failover takes 60–120 seconds (single standby) | [Multi-AZ Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.Failover.html) | Applications experience 1-2 min downtime minimum |
| FT-02 | Multi-AZ with two readable standbys: failover <35 seconds | [Multi-AZ Features](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/) | Only available for PostgreSQL and MySQL; not all engines |
| FT-03 | Large transactions or lengthy recovery processes INCREASE failover time beyond 120s | [Multi-AZ Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.Failover.html) | Unpredictable failover duration under load |
| FT-04 | Aurora DNS TTL = 5 seconds, but client/JVM/OS DNS caching can extend staleness | [DNS Caching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/amazon-aurora-mysql-db-admin-handbook/dns-caching.html) | Applications route to dead endpoint until cache expires |
| FT-05 | RDS (non-Aurora) DNS CNAME TTL = 60 seconds | [Multi-AZ Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.Failover.html) | 60s of stale routing even after failover completes |
| FT-06 | Aurora single-writer cluster without readers: NO automatic failover target exists | [Aurora Fast Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.BestPractices.FastFailover.html) | Must launch new instance from scratch (10-15 min) |
| FT-07 | Aurora secondary cluster readers restart when primary writer restarts or fails over | [Aurora Global Database Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html) | Global database secondary becomes unavailable during primary events |
| FT-08 | Single-AZ RDS instance: AZ failure = full outage requiring snapshot restore | [Due to the lack of standby instances, a Single-AZ instance cannot failover during an AZ outage](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/choose-the-right-amazon-rds-deployment-option-single-az-instance-multi-az-instance-or-multi-az-database-cluster/).|  The RPO with an Amazon RDS Single-AZ instance is typically 5 minutes, which is based on the timeout interval for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3. This time may vary due to open transactions, engine specific settings, loss of network connectivity to Amazon S3, and instance class (network/disk/heavy workload) limits |

### Category 2: SNAPSHOT RESTORE CONSTRAINTS

| ID | Blocker | Documentation Source | Impact |
|----|---------|---------------------|--------|
| SR-01 | Snapshot restore uses LAZY LOADING from S3 — data loads in background | [Restoring from Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Instance shows "available" but first-access reads hit S3 latency |
| SR-02 | Changing storage type during restore SLOWS the process significantly | [Restoring from Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Migration between magnetic/gp2/gp3/io1 adds substantial time |
| SR-03 | Cannot restore to an EXISTING instance — always creates NEW instance | [Restoring from Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Endpoint changes; application reconfiguration required |
| SR-04 | Cannot reduce allocated storage on restore | [Restoring from Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Storage size locked at snapshot time |
| SR-05 | Default parameter group assigned on restore — custom parameters LOST ,unless you choose a different one| [Parameter Group Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Performance tuning, replication settings, memory config all revert to defaults |
| SR-06 | Default VPC security group assigned on restore — access rules LOST | [Security Group Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Restored DB may be unreachable until SG manually re-applied |
| SR-07 | Aurora PITR restores ONLY the cluster — DB instances must be created separately | [restore_db_cluster_to_point_in_time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/boto3/latest/reference/services/rds/client/restore_db_cluster_to_point_in_time.html) | Additional 5-10 min per instance after cluster restore |
| SR-08 | Aurora PITR granularity: transaction logs uploaded to S3 every 5 minutes | [PITR for RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html) | Maximum 5-minute RPO gap even with continuous backups |
| SR-09 | Cannot restore directly from a shared and encrypted RDS snapshot in a cross-account scenario | [Restoring from Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html) | Must first copy it to the target account (re-encrypting with the KMS key of the target account) and only then restore from the copy,which adds  time to the recovery process.|
| SR-10 | Sometimes, Amazon RDS PITR takes significant time to complete, and sometimes PITR completes quickly | [Operational observation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-rds-snapshot-restore-and-recovery-demystified/) | PITR of an Amazon RDS instance has two components: restore and replay of transaction logs. The time required to perform the volume restore is standard. The amount of time required to replay transaction logs is dependent on the number and size of transactions logs that exist between the time that the previous automated snapshot was taken and the time specified in the PITR API call. Therefore, the difference during PITR of the same Amazon RDS instance during different a PITR window is dependent on the duration needed to replay the transaction logs |

| EN-04 | AWS-managed KMS key (aws/rds) CANNOT be used for cross-account backup copy | [Cross-Account Backups](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protecting-amazon-rds-db-instances-encrypted-using-kms-aws-managed-key-with-cross-account-and-cross-region-backups/) | Must use customer-managed CMK for any cross-account DR |
| EN-05 | KMS `inaccessible-encryption-credentials` state is TERMINAL for Aurora Global Database clusters | [Aurora Global Database Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html) | No recovery possible if KMS key access is lost |

### Category 4: KMS API THROTTLING

| ID | Blocker | Documentation Source | Impact |
|----|---------|---------------------|--------|
| KT-01 | Symmetric cryptographic operations quota: 5,500 req/s in most regions (10,000 in us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1) | [KMS Request Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/requests-per-second.html) | Parallel encrypted restores share this quota with ALL other services |
| KT-02 | KMS quota is SHARED across all services using the same key in the same region | [KMS Throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/throttling.html) | RDS restore competes with S3 SSE, EBS, Lambda, etc. for KMS capacity |
| KT-03 | Exceeding KMS quota returns ThrottlingException — restore operations may stall or fail | [KMS ThrottlingException](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/kms-throttlingexception-error) | DR event with many parallel restores can self-throttle |
| KT-04 | CreateGrant quota: 50 req/s — each encrypted RDS operation requires a KMS grant | [KMS Request Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/requests-per-second.html) | Bottleneck when restoring many encrypted instances simultaneously |

### Category 6: APPLICATION-LAYER RESILIENCE GAPS

| ID | Blocker | Documentation Source | Impact |
|----|---------|---------------------|--------|

### Category 7: ACCOUNT-LEVEL SERVICE QUOTAS (Silent DR Blockers)

| ID | Blocker | Default Limit | Impact |
|----|---------|---------------|--------|
| QT-01 | Manual DB cluster snapshots per account | 100 | Cannot create pre-DR safety snapshot if at limit; blocks snapshot-based DR initiation |
| QT-02 | Manual DB instance snapshots per account | 100 | Same as QT-01 for RDS instances; blocks backup-before-failover pattern |
| QT-03 | DB instances per account (per region) | 40 | Cannot restore/create instances in DR region if at limit; blocks all restore operations |
| QT-04 | DB clusters per account (per region) | 40 | Cannot create new Aurora cluster from snapshot in target region |
| QT-05 | Total storage across all DB instances per account | 100 TB | Large fleet restore may exceed; new instances rejected |
| QT-06 | Cross-region automated backup replications per account | 20 | Cannot replicate all DBs cross-region if fleet >20; forces prioritization |
| QT-07 | Concurrent cross-region snapshot copies per destination region | 5 | Mass DR event bottleneck — only 5 copies at a time, remaining queue adds 15-60+ min per batch to RTO |
| QT-08 | DB parameter groups per account | 50 | Cannot create custom PG in DR region; restored instances get default PG (SR-05 cascade) |
| QT-09 | DB subnet groups per account | 50 | Cannot restore in DR region without available subnet group slot |
| QT-10 | Aurora Global Databases per account | 5 | Limits how many clusters can have cross-region DR via Global Database |
| QT-11 | Read replicas per source instance | 5 (RDS) / 15 (Aurora readers) | Limits HA topology depth; cannot add more failover targets |

| QT-13 | Event subscriptions per account | 20 | May miss DR/failover alerts if subscription limit reached |
| QT-14 | Reserved DB instances per account | 40 | DR region may lack reserved capacity; on-demand pricing during DR event |
| QT-15 | KMS CreateGrant API calls | 50 req/sec | Each encrypted RDS operation needs a grant; parallel restores of encrypted fleet self-throttle |
| QT-16 | KMS grants per key | 50,000 | Theoretical limit; large fleets with frequent restores/clones can approach |
| QT-17 | Option groups per account | 20 | RDS restore in DR region may fail if option group limit reached (Oracle/SQL Server) |
| QT-18 | Custom endpoints per Aurora cluster | 5 | Post-DR cluster may not recreate all custom endpoints |
| QT-19 | Proxies per account | 20 | Cannot deploy RDS Proxy in DR region if at limit; breaks HA pattern |
| QT-20 | IAM roles per account (for monitoring/proxy) | 1,000 | Unlikely but complex DR automation may need roles |

```

---

## QUOTA ASSESSMENT COMMANDS

```bash
# Primary command — shows all RDS quota usage vs limits in one call
aws rds describe-account-attributes --region {{REGION}}

# Detailed quota limits (if custom limits were requested)
aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code rds --region {{REGION}}

# Check DR target region headroom
aws rds describe-account-attributes --region {{DR_REGION}}

# Check KMS quota usage
aws service-quotas get-service-quota \
  --service-code kms \
  --quota-code L-6E388A8A \
  --region {{REGION}}
```

---

## QUOTA-AWARE RTO ADJUSTMENT FORMULA

```
# When concurrent snapshot copy limit (5) affects mass DR:
adjusted_rto_per_db = base_rto + (batch_position / 5) * avg_copy_time

# Example: 8 databases, avg copy time 20 min
# Batch 1 (DBs 1-5): RTO = base_rto + 0 = 30 min
# Batch 2 (DBs 6-8): RTO = base_rto + 20 min = 50 min

# When instance quota blocks restore:
# RTO = ∞ until quota increase approved (hours to days via AWS Support)
```

---

## RTO/RPO CALCULATION FORMULAS

### Snapshot-Based Recovery (Backup & Restore Pattern)

```
RTO = snapshot_locate_time
    + restore_initiation_time
    + instance_boot_time (size-dependent, lazy-loading)
    + parameter_group_reapply_time
    + security_group_reapply_time  
    + dns_propagation_time
    + application_reconnection_time
    + data_warmup_time (if performance-critical)

Typical RTO by DB size:
  < 100 GB:  15-30 minutes
  100-500 GB: 30-60 minutes
  500 GB-1 TB: 60-90 minutes
  > 1 TB: 90-180+ minutes

RPO = backup_frequency (automated: up to 24h) 
    + transaction_log_upload_interval (5 minutes for PITR)
    
Typical RPO:
  With PITR: 5 minutes maximum
  Without PITR (snapshot only): up to 24 hours
```

### Multi-AZ Failover (In-Region)

```
RTO = failover_detection_time
    + dns_update_time
    + client_dns_cache_expiry (JVM/OS/network)
    + connection_pool_drain_time

Typical RTO:
  RDS Single Standby: 60-120 seconds
  RDS Two Standbys: <35 seconds  
  Aurora with readers: 15-30 seconds (with proper config)
  Aurora without readers: 10-15 minutes (must provision new instance)

RPO = 0 (synchronous replication within AZ pair)
```

### Aurora Global Database (Cross-Region)

```
RTO = failure_detection_time
    + switchover/failover_execution (typically <1 minute)
    + dns_propagation (5s TTL * 2-3 cycles)
    + application_reconnection

Typical RTO:
  Planned switchover: <1 minute
  Unplanned failover: 1-2 minutes
  Manual failover (version mismatch): 5-15 minutes

RPO = replication_lag (typically <1 second, but varies under load)
```

## REMEDIATION PLAYBOOK TEMPLATES

### P1 — Enable Multi-AZ (Zero Downtime)
```bash
# Deferred (recommended) — applies during next maintenance window

aws rds modify-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier {{INSTANCE_ID}} --multi-az --region {{REGION}}

# Immediate — WARNING: --apply-immediately can trigger a failover / brief outage NOW

#   append --apply-immediately only if you accept that risk
```
**Impact:** RTO drops from 30-60min to 60-120s. Cost: ~2x instance.

### P1 — Add Aurora Reader (Zero Downtime)
```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-reader-1 \
  --db-instance-class {{INSTANCE_CLASS}} \
  --engine aurora-postgresql \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}} \
  --availability-zone {{DIFFERENT_AZ}} \
  --region {{REGION}}
```
**Impact:** Enables automatic failover. RTO drops to <30s.

### P2 — Encrypt Existing Database (Requires Downtime)
```bash
# 1. Create snapshot
aws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}} \
  --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-pre-encrypt

# 2. Copy with encryption
aws rds copy-db-cluster-snapshot \
  --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-pre-encrypt \
  --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-encrypted \
  --kms-key-id {{KMS_KEY_ARN}}

# 3. Restore encrypted cluster (NEW endpoint)
aws rds restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-encrypted \
  --snapshot-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-encrypted \
  --engine aurora-postgresql \
  --engine-version {{ENGINE_VERSION}}

# 4. Create instance in new cluster
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-encrypted-writer \
  --db-instance-class {{INSTANCE_CLASS}} \
  --engine aurora-postgresql \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{CLUSTER_ID}}-encrypted
```
**⚠️ Endpoint changes. Application must be updated. Plan maintenance window.**

### P3 — Setup Aurora Global Database
```bash
# Prerequisite: cluster must be encrypted + correct version
aws rds create-global-cluster \
  --global-cluster-identifier {{GLOBAL_ID}} \
  --source-db-cluster-identifier {{PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ARN}} \
  --region {{PRIMARY_REGION}}

# Add secondary region
aws rds create-db-cluster \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{SECONDARY_CLUSTER_ID}} \
  --engine aurora-postgresql \
  --engine-version {{VERSION}} \
  --global-cluster-identifier {{GLOBAL_ID}} \
  --region {{SECONDARY_REGION}}

# Add instance to secondary
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier {{SECONDARY_CLUSTER_ID}}-reader-1 \
  --db-instance-class {{INSTANCE_CLASS}} \
  --engine aurora-postgresql \
  --db-cluster-identifier {{SECONDARY_CLUSTER_ID}} \
  --region {{SECONDARY_REGION}}
```
**Result:** RPO <1s, RTO <1min for regional failure.
